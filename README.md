# speedreader
A java project to help read faster

# Note
I reccomend viewing the plaintext version of this document so the table looks pretty.

# Participants
Nina Kouchi - [kouchini]
Sean Collins - [collinss2]

# Testing
Full questions with word for word answers of participants can be found in the ---test.txt files.


__Results__

Speed   |250|350|500|Control|  
Nina    |  3|  2|  3|      3|  
Sean    |  2|  3|  2|      5|   

__Summary__
For the first two participants tested there didn't seem to be a significant diversion from the control as the speed was raised.
This leads to the conclusion that the speedreader works relatively well, as it did not significantly impact comprehension.
It is worth noting that Sean already had considerable background information about Kendrick Lamar, which skews his control score.
